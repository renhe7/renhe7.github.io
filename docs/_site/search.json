I’m enthusiast when it comes to hobbies like traveling, listening to music, and photography. I find solace in those moments when I’m alone with my thoughts, particularly on rainy days. The sound of raindrops hitting the window pane brings me a sense of inner peace.\nDuring such days, I’d rather cozy up in bed with a good book and let my mind wander. It’s like stepping into another world where all the chores fade away. Music, to me, is like a universal remedy for whatever ails me, especially after a long and tiring day; it has a magical way of soothing my emotions. In addition, I currently serve as the stage manager for the KECD CCA. It’s a role that has turned out to be more demanding than I initially imagined. Despite the exhaustion, I find immense satisfaction in immersing myself in the backstage operations and gaining a deeper insight into the drama production process.\n\n\n\nHello\n\n\n\n\nCourse Content\nweek1\nweek2\nweek3\nweek4\nweek5\nweek6\nweek7\nweek8\nweek9"
