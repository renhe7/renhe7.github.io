### Self-introduction
Hey there! I'm Renhe, a second-year student majoring in *Communication & New Media* at NUS. I'm enthusiast when it comes to hobbies like traveling, listening to music, and photography. I find solace in those moments when I'm alone with my thoughts, particularly on rainy days. The sound of raindrops hitting the window pane brings me a sense of *inner peace*.

During such days, I'd rather cozy up in bed with a good book and let my mind wander. It's like stepping into another world where all the chores fade away. Music, to me, is like a universal remedy for whatever ails me, especially after a long and tiring day; it has a magical way of soothing my emotions. In addition, I currently serve as the stage manager for the KECD CCA. It's a role that has turned out to be more demanding than I initially imagined. Despite the exhaustion, I find immense satisfaction in immersing myself in the backstage operations and gaining a deeper insight into the drama production process.
